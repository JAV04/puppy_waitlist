Simple waitlist app built for a dog breeder automatically keep track of their clients information, needs, and position in line. 

1) Admin has the ability to send an invite to users who pay their deposit fee via stripe.
2) Admin can create "litters" with information about the parents, number of puppies, etc.
3) User registers an account with the pin provided in the invite email and configures information about themselves, and what kind of puppy they are looking for.
4) As litters become available, those who registered first are at the top of the list, and have priority in selection. Admin gets a report of which clients get to choose the dog first (no more need for excel lists!)
